## About The Project

<p>This application was developed using Expo, which enabled rapid development and streamlined the build process for both iOS and Android platforms. The user interface is styled with Tailwind CSS, allowing for a responsive and visually appealing design that enhances the overall user experience.

For backend services, I utilized Appwrite, a powerful open-source backend platform. Appwrite efficiently handles user data storage, authentication, and real-time database functionalities, ensuring that user information is secure and easily accessible.</p>
